      <h2>My Education</h2>

        <p>
          During my undergraduate studies, I pursued a
          <span class="highlight"
            >Bachelor of Science in Computing and Information Systems
            (BSCCSIT)</span
          >
          from a reputed university. The program provided me with a solid
          foundation in various areas of computer science, including
          <span class="highlight"
            >software development, database management, networking, and web
            technologies</span
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through my coursework and projects, I gained hands-on experience in
          <span class="highlight">programming languages</span> like Java,
          Python, and C++, as well as exposure to emerging technologies such as
          <span class="highlight"
            >AI, machine learning, and cloud computing</span
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, my BSCCSIT degree equipped me with both technical skills and
          problem-solving capabilities, which I continue to build upon in my
          professional journey.
